### Reporting bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for SmartCredentials library. Following these guidelines help maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior and find related reports.

#### How do I submit a __good__ bug report?
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). When you are creating a bug report, please follow the best practices listed below and use the required [template](http://www.google.com).

**Essential to have**:

- First of all, __check if the bug is already known__ (check whether or not the bug you found is already documented in the [issue tracker](www.bugslist.com)). If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. 
- Add the bug a __short and precise title__ (e.g. “Unable to log into the system when username contains foreign characters” and __not__ “User cannot work in Chinese”).
- Reproduce the bug __more than one time__ before reporting it.
- Offer __a concise but complete description__ of the issue. Include the steps to reproduce, the consequences of the bug and the suggested behavior
- __Attach relevant screenshots__, __videos__ or __log files__ that help developers to understand better the malfunction of the feature
- If you notice multiple bugs, __file them separately__ so they can be tracked easier and do not mix the bugs.

**Nice to have**:

- Add a __Severity & Priority__ (if not sure, leave it as default or medium).
- __Follow-up__ on the bug reported and __provide comments__ when necessary.
- __Be nice__ while logging a bug and avoid using caps lock or exclamation marks even though you are a bit annoyed of the situation.

**You are awesome if**: 

- You are already awesome for finding the bug and for reporting it.
- You put as much effort into your question as you expect to be put into its response

## 3. Coding standards
If you're writing content, see the following [coding standards](http://www.google.com) to be sure that your content matches with the rest of the code.

## 4. Community
We are open for any contribution on the topic of credential management, authentication and user-centric identity.
Even more are we looking for partners who have an interest in adding their solutions to the list of existing modules. However, if you have good reason to think it would be good to have **someone else's solution** adapted, you might just be the person who simply does it. Just make sure you are **allowed** to handle the code or executable in question.

Discussions about the SmartCredentials library take place on this Slack [channel](http://www.google.com). Anybody is welcome to join these conversations. There is also a [mailing list](http://www.google.com) for regular updates.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
